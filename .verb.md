## Usage

Should work with any collection of vinyl files.

```js
const getView = require('{%= name %}');
```

**[templates][] example**

Given the following setup code, all of the below examples would return a view from the `app.views.pages` collection:

```js
const templates = require('templates');
app = templates();
app.create('page');

app.page('foo', {content: 'this is foo'});
app.page('bar.md', {content: 'this is bar'});
app.page('a/b/c/baz.md', {content: 'this is baz', base: 'a'});
app.page('test/fixtures/templates/a.tmpl');
```

Get a view by customizing the lookup key with a function:

```js
const view = getView(app.views.pages, function(view) {
  return view.stem === 'foo.md';
});

//=> <View "foo" <Buffer 74 68 69 73 20 69>>
```

Get a view by `view.path`

```js
const view = getView(app.views.pages, 'a/b/c/baz.md');
//=> <View "b/c/baz.md" <Buffer 74 68 69 73>>
```

Get a view by `view.basename`

```js
const view = getView(app.views.pages, 'baz.md');
//=> <View "b/c/baz.md" <Buffer 74 68 69 73>>
```

Get a view by `view.filename`

```js
const view = getView(app.views.pages, 'baz');
//=> <View "b/c/baz.md" <Buffer 74 68 69 73>>
```

Get a view by `view.relative`

```js
const view = getView(app.views.pages, 'b/c/baz.md');
//=> <View "b/c/baz.md" <Buffer 74 68 69 73>>
```

## Release history

### v2.0

**Breaking changes**

- The order of arguments has been reversed, so that the collection of views is passed first, and the lookup value is second. 
- No longer matches with globs. This can be done by passing a glob matcher as the second argument.
